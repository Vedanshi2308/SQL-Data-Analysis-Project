# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project

Objective
This project is designed for beginners to explore SQL-based data analysis using a music playlist dataset. By querying the dataset, we can help Spotify Music Company understand business growth by answering critical business questions.

Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of multiple tables that provide detailed information about albums, artists, customers, employees, genres, invoices, and tracks. Key tables include Album, Artist, Customer, Invoice, Track, and Playlist, which are linked to each other through relationships like purchases, track listings, and customer data. This dataset allows analysis of music sales, customer behavior, and track popularity.
